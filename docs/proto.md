Both Protocol Buffer versions 2 (proto2) and 3 (proto3) have their pros and cons.

Proto2 is the original version of Protocol Buffers and has a number of features that are not present in proto3. However, proto2 is also more verbose and has more complicated language features, which can make it harder to use and maintain.

Proto3 is a simplified version of Protocol Buffers that was introduced to make it easier to use and maintain. Proto3 has fewer language features, but is still expressive enough to model most data structures. Proto3 is also more compact than proto2, making it more efficient to serialize and transmit.

In general, it's recommended to use proto3 if you're starting a new project or if you're migrating from proto2. Proto3 is the default version in many gRPC implementations and has a simpler syntax that is easier to learn and use.

If you're already using proto2 and are happy with its features, there may be no need to switch to proto3. However, if you're having trouble with the complexity of proto2, it may be worth considering a migration to proto3 to simplify your code.
